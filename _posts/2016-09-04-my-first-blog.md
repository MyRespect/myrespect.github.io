Welcome to Guangjing's first blog! In this blog, I would like to talk about my movitation for building my blog, and my plan for wiriting blogs in the future. I would appreciate it if someone reads my blog and gives feedback to me.  




I am so happy to have my own blog site on the Internet. It was my dream, but now is true! Still, I have several things to do now, such as learning Markdown Grammar, making a blueprint for my blog.   

To begin with, let us start to learn Markdown under the instruction [here](http://www.jianshu.com/p/1e402922ee32/).    

#### **Notes：**

* 在 Markdown 中，如果一段文字被定义为标题，只要在这段文字前加 # 号即可, 几级标题就加几个井号, 总共六级标题，建议在井号后加一个空格;  

* 列表的显示只需要在文字前加上 - 或 * 即可变为无序列表，有序列表则直接在文字前加1. 2. 3. 符号要和文字之间加上一个字符的空格;  

* 如果你需要引用一小段别处的句子，只需要在文本前加入 > 这种尖括号（大于号）即可;  

* 如果需要在文章里优雅的引用代码框, 只需要用两个 \` 把中间的代码包裹起来;  

* 用两个 * 包含一段文本就是 **粗体** 的语法，用一个 * 包含一段文本就是 *斜体*  的语法, 割线的语法只需要三个 * 号; 

* 最上面的---一定要放在第一行，不能有空行;摘要和正文之间要空四行; 

* 使用空行来表示换行，特别是使用(1)(2)时，一定要空行写．

It is time to talk about my motivation and plan for my blog. Tomorrow is the first school day in my senior year formally. And I will not have so many bothersome subjects. So I need to kill my spare time, and writing blogs is a wonderful thing to do. Now I am reading a book named "Machine Learning with R" by Brett Lantz, which is a so nice book that I want to copy every words in my blog. What's more, I will try to write blogs using English in order to improve my English writing skills, though I still use Chinese somewhere for convenience.  

My blog will have two parts for the moment---Machine Learning with R and Miscellanies. In the future, I believe I can rich my blog by sharing my work and ideas with you! In the end, thanks for the help of those generous people on the Internet, otherwise I won't be able to build my blog site so quickly.
