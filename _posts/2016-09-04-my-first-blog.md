Welcome to Guangjing's first blog! In this blog, I would like to talk about my movitation for building my blog, and my plan for wiriting blogs in the future. I would appreciate it if someone reads my blog and gives feedback to me.  




I am so happy to have my own blog site on the Internet. It was my dream, but now is true! Still, I have several things to do now, such as learning Markdown Grammar, making a blueprint for my blog.   

To begin with, let us start to learn Markdown under the instruction [here](http://www.jianshu.com/p/1e402922ee32/).    

#### **Notes**

* In Markdown, if you want to define a title, you neet to add # before the characters. There are total six classes, corresponding to six #s.  

* If you want to use bulleted list, you need to add - or * , or you can add number.+blank space for numbering;  

* Using > before text that you quote others.   

* **overstriking** and *italic* 

* There should not be blank line in the top and there are at least four blank lines after your abstract. 

* Using the blank line to have line feed.

#### **TAG**

It is time to talk about my motivation and plan for my blog. Tomorrow is the first school day in my senior year formally. And I will not have so many bothersome subjects. So I need to kill my spare time, and writing blogs is a wonderful thing to do. Now I am reading a book named "Machine Learning with R" by Brett Lantz, which is a so nice book that I want to copy every words in my blog. What's more, I will try to write blogs using English in order to improve my English writing skills, though I still use Chinese somewhere for convenience.  

My blog will have two parts for the moment---Machine Learning with R and Miscellanies. In the future, I believe I can rich my blog by sharing my work and ideas with you! In the end, thanks for the help of those generous people on the Internet, otherwise I won't be able to build my blog site so quickly.
